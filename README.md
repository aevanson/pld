# PLD Evaluation

This demo uses Angular and Bootstrap, and the basic framework was created using the Yeoman generator by Swiip: [generator-angular-gulp](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular).

A lot of the files are framework related, but the ones to check out that are specific to this demo are in these files and folders:

```
src/app/index.scss
src/app/components/
src/app/main/
```

I've also included the the /dist output for easy previewing. Because of the dynamically loaded JSON file, this will have to be opened locally over localhost or the browser won't load the file.

I've also uploaded the dist output to my own server: [http://aevanson.com/razorfish/](http://aevanson.com/razorfish/#/).
